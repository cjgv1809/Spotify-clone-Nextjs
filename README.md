## How to use

While playing any song in your saved playlist, you can listen to that song on your device (i.e., cell phone) by keeping the Spotify app open, essentially using it as a remote control. Please note that this feature is available with a Spotify Premium account, subject to limitations imposed by the Spotify API.
